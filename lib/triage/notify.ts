 * (one sa_notifications row each — own-row RLS already scopes reads).
 *
 * The sink itself moved to lib/notifications/sink.ts when appointment
 * reminders became its second consumer; it is re-exported here so triage
 * and resus (lib/resus/mobilise.ts) keep importing from one place.
 *
 * What changed underneath: an SMS transport now exists
 * (lib/notifications/africastalking.ts), so the blocker on staff alerts is
 * no longer transport but data — nothing in the schema stores a staff
 * phone number. See the note on `stubbedNotificationSink`.
